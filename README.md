# Employee Requests - Minimal API

Originally made to pair with [RequestHandler](https://github.com/briannarenni/RequestHandler-221024), a C# console app. This version of the API was created for 221024 training, and hasn't been updated to use async operations yet.

Uses:
- ASP.NET Core 7
- Swagger/OpenAPI
- Azure database
